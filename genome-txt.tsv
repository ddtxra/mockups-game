	https://www.wired.com/2008/10/the-gene-for-jamaican-sprinting-success-no-not-really/ (blog entry of author)	ACTN3	gène	actn3-text	The protein encoded by the ACTN3 gene is active in skeletal muscles. It influences the "explosive" power of the muscle. The T-allele leads to a non-functional protein. Individuals with this allele (about 1/6th-1/4th of the human population) have lower muscle power, a reduced sprinting performance and have a better endurance capacity. Individuals with a C-allele in contrast, can built up more muscle strength. However, the C-allele explains only 2-3% of sprinting variability and diet and training contribute strongly to the performance.		
				actn3-short-text	Your muscles just became more powerful!		
	http://www.pnas.org/content/81/1/258	ALDH2	gène	aldh2-text	The ALDH2 gene encodes a protein, which metabolizes alcohol.

				brca1-short-text	This mutation can be used to assess the risk of breast cancer.		
		CYP1A2	gène	cyp1a2-text	The CYP1A2 gene encodes a protein, which is involved in various metabolic processes such as the drug metabolism or cholesterol synthesis. Individuals with the C-allele metabolize for example coffeine slower. A slower caffeine metabolizm means that one cup of coffee has a stronger effect on them, because the caffeine remains longer in the system.	should we do it the other way around? fast metabolizer needs more coffee that's why he has a coffee mug how is cyp1a2 altered by the allele?	
				cyp1a2-short-text	Coffee has a strong effect on you!		
	https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/17/6/835/601141 https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00439-013-1324-1	EDAR	gène	edar-text	The protein encoded by the EDAR gene has important developmental functions. It is expressed at the cell surface and influences the interaction of cells that form for example skin, hair or teeth. The C-allele reduces the efficiency of the protein to activate other proteins, which leads to thicker and straighter hair.

This variation leads to a malformation of the red blood cells causing a disease known as "sickel cell anemia". Individuals with a single A-allele of the gene (either from the mum or the father) are healthy and are more resistant to the Malaria parasite, which cannot bind to the red blood cell anymore. Individuals with two A-alleles, suffer from sickle cell anemia.		
				hbb-short-text	Your red blood cells have a different shape but you are more resitant to maleria!		
		HERC2	gène	herc2-text	The G-allele is found in the intron of the HERC2 gene. It has no influence on the HERC2 protein itself, but instead influences the protein production of the neighboring OCA2 gene. The protein produced by the OCA2 gene is essential for the synthesis of melanin (a dark pigment). The G-allele leads to lower levels of the OCA2 protein, fewer pigments in the cells and subsequently to a higher probability of having blue eyes. This allele is very common in Europe.	This variation influences the production of melanine. The melanine pigments concentration varies and in this case your chances are to have blue eyes!
